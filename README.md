Project : Student Grade Tracker

1. Understanding the Problem
Develop a program that can record, manage, and calculate grades for students.

2. Core Functionalities
Allow users to add student details (name, ID, etc.).
Enable input of grades for multiple subjects.
Calculate the overall grade/percentage or GPA.
Provide feedback on performance (e.g., pass/fail, grade category).

3. User-Friendly Interface
Implement a menu-driven program or a simple command-line interface (CLI) for navigation.
Provide options like adding grades, viewing grades, and calculating averages.

4. Data Management
Use Python data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.) to store student and grade information.
Optional: Save and retrieve data using files (e.g., CSV or text files) or databases.

5. Error Handling
Handle invalid input gracefully, such as non-numeric grades or missing student data.
Provide meaningful error messages and prompts.

6. Modularization
Break the program into functions for better organization (e.g., add_student(), calculate_average()).

7. Bonus Objectives (Optional)
Sort and display students based on grades or names.
Generate a report card or summary for each student.
Implement a graphical interface (GUI) using tools like Tkinter for better usability.
Support multiple users or sessions.
